What is it?
-----------

**lifemodels** is a Python package for fitting lifespan data to a number of models using MLE.  It also implements GLM (generalized linear model) for those lifespan distributions.

It is the next version of **deday**. **deday** stands for *Demography Data Analyses*.  The older versions can be found [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/deday/).

**[Read the minimal example](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ctzhu/lifemodels/blob/master/examples/Intro_example.ipynb)** or [slides](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ctzhu/lifemodels/blob/master/examples/Intro_example.ipynb) for a simple workflow in `IPython Notebook` 

Where to find support?
-------------

[**Read the documentation**](https://github.com/ctzhu/lifemodels/blob/master/doc/Guide.txt) for instructions (not ready yet, TODO).
